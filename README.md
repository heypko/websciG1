Throughout the course of the Fall semester, an online statute repository for the Nassau County SPCA was produced and published for the organization. This application provides online reference info and organizational tools to sort and reuse popular legal codes. The application has some improvement areas that have been identified, particularly in getting rough location data from officers in the field, updating the statute repository automatically without the need for user intervention, and overall site user interface improvement. Web Science Group 1 has set out to make these changes and help the new application become even more effective in the NCSPCA.
